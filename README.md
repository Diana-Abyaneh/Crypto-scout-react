### 🔐 API Configuration

This app uses CoinGecko, a public cryptocurrency API to fetch exchange rates and market data.
 • ✅ No API key is required
 • ⚠️ However, CoinGecko has rate limits. If you send too many requests in a short period, the API may temporarily block you and return error responses.
 • 🧠 To avoid this, try to minimize unnecessary requests.
